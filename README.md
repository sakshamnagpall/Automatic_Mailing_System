## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- A Gmail account for sending emails
- Maven (if using Maven for dependency management)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automatic-mailing-java.git
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.

## Configuration

In the `AutomaticMailer.java` file, update the following variables with your own information:

- `senderEmail`: Your Gmail email address.
- `senderPassword`: Your Gmail account password.
- `receiverEmail`: Email address of the recipient.

**Note:** For security reasons, it is not recommended to hardcode your email and password directly in the code. Consider using more secure methods, such as environment variables or a configuration file.

## Run the Application

Run the `AutomaticMailer` class to execute the program. This will send an email to the specified recipient.


### Compile the Java code
javac AutomaticMailer.java

### Run the application
java AutomaticMailer

Make sure that your Gmail account allows access to less secure apps. If not, you may need to enable the "Allow less secure apps" option in your Google account settings.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the code according to your requirements. You may want to:

- Implement error handling and logging.
- Use OAuth2 authentication for enhanced security.
- Allow user input for dynamic email content and recipient addresses.
- Add more features, such as attachments or HTML content.

For security reasons, it is highly recommended not to hardcode sensitive information directly in the code. Consider using secure methods like environment variables or a configuration file.
